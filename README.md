# savethebabies
A crappy game I made last summer before I had learned how to write decent code that wasn't overly complicated.

It runs on pygame https://www.pygame.org/.

This is just such a dumb and poorly executed game that I can't help but love.
You literally drag items around to keep them away from the babies.
Green aura items heal babies and white aura items are neutral.

Kill bosses (sword is the preferential weapon).

Press g to toggle violence.
